# API Overview

The following denotes the HTTPS-based API for [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com). It provides browser-as-a-service for automated cross-browser testing. The goal is to provide a simple service which can easily be used by any browser testing framework.

## Authentication

All methods need to authenticate who you are, before spawning browser workers and deleting a worker for example. Authentication is done using your username and the BrowserStack access key within the HTTP request.

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5
```

> Note: _A `401 Unauthorized` response is received if an unauthorized request is made._

## Schema

All requests are made to `https://api.browserstack.com/VERSION/` and all returned data is done so in JSON-format. This documentation outlines version 5.

```bash
curl -i -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf8
Status: 200 OK
X-API-Version: 5

{}
```

All date formats are given in ISO-8601 which can be processed natively with `Date.parse` in compatible JavaScript environments.

## Error Handling

All requests are pre-processed and validated. This section outlines how we handle errors within the API and respond to them.

All API requests are validated. The following is an example output for a required parameter that wasn't given.

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Length: 136

{
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "type",
      "code": "required"
    }
  ]
}
```

Possible error codes are `required` and `invalid`.

## HTTP Verbs

The API is kept concise and simple by making use of relevant HTTP verbs on each request. The specifications for these are vague and their use within this API is specific but in general, we follow the following rules:

* `HEAD` - Performs the request to assess the status of a resource and expects no content response.
* `GET` - Used to retrieve resources.
* `POST` - Used to create new resources.
* `PUT` - Used to update resources.
* `DELETE` - Used to delete resources.

## Getting Available Browsers

Fetches all available browsers.

```http
GET /browsers
```

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5/browsers
```

Output:

```javascript
{
  'Windows':
    {
      '10':
        [
          {
            "browser": "chrome",
            "browser_version": "83.0"
          },
          {
            "browser": "chrome",
            "browser_version": "84.0"
          },
          {
            "browser": "chrome",
            "browser_version": "85.0 beta"
          },
          {
            "browser": "ie",
            "browser_version": "11.0"
          },
          {
            "browser": "edge",
            "browser_version": "insider preview"
          }...
        ],
    },
  'OS X':
    {
      'Catalina':
        [
          {
            "browser": "chrome",
            "browser_version": "85.0 beta"
          },
          {
            "browser": "edge",
            "browser_version": "85.0 beta"
          },
          {
            "browser": "safari",
            "browser_version": "13.1"
          },
          {
            "browser": "firefox",
            "browser_version": "79.0"
          },
          {
            "browser": "firefox",
            "browser_version": "80.0 beta"
          }...
        ],
      }...
    },
}
```

A flat parameter can also be passed to get browsers in a flat structure

```http
GET /browsers?flat=true
```

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5/browsers?flat=true
```

Output:

```javascript
[  
  {
    "os": "Windows",
    "os_version": "10",
    "browser": "chrome",
    "device": null,
    "browser_version": "84.0",
    "real_mobile": null
  },
  {
    "os": "Windows",
    "os_version": "10",
    "browser": "edge",
    "device": null,
    "browser_version": "85.0 beta",
    "real_mobile": null
  },
  {
    "os": "OS X",
    "os_version": "Catalina",
    "browser": "firefox",
    "device": null,
    "browser_version": "79.0",
    "real_mobile": null
  },
  {
    "os": "OS X",
    "os_version": "Catalina",
    "browser": "firefox",
    "device": null,
    "browser_version": "80.0 beta",
    "real_mobile": null
  }....
]
```

## Create a New Browser Worker

A browser worker is simply a new browser instance. A user can start multiple browser worker at a time.
All browser workers when created are pushed in a queue and they run when their turn comes. We make sure that your browser worker starts running as soon as possible. Your testing time is calculated from the time when browser worker starts running.

```http
POST /worker
```

> Note: _This call requires authentication. A `401 Unauthorized` response is given if an unauthorized request is made._

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" -X POST -d '{"os":"OS X","os_version":"Mojave","url":"https://browserstack.com","browser":"chrome","browser_version":"75.0"}' https://api.browserstack.com/5/worker -H 'content-type: application/json'
```

Response:

```bash
{"id":123456789,"url":"https://browserstack.com"}
```

Once a worker has been spawned you can then control this browser instance remotely. You can also look at the testing session status at the [Automate Dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/dashboard). This will provide you with the general details about the session and a live preview of the remote machine.

### Parameters

### Response

The response will be returned when the worker has been set up and initialized. This involves loading the HTML data or navigating to the url given depending on the setup parameters. Use the `id` returned to perform any further communications etc.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 Success
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Version: 5

{
  "id": "123456789"
}
```

### Screenshots

Use this method to take a screenshot at the current state of the worker.

```http
GET /worker/<id>/screenshot(.format)
```

Acceptable formats are `json`, `xml` and `png`. This information can also be provided via the HTTP `Accept` headers: `text/json`, `text/xml`, `image/png` respectively.

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5/worker/123456789/screenshot.json
```

## Get Details of all Browser Workers
This API request returns comprehensive information of all browser workers youâ€™ve created. Also, it will return the status of the workers - either `queue` or `running`.
 
```http
GET /workers
```
Example request:
```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" -X GET https://api.browserstack.com/5/workers 
```
 
Example response:
```javascript
[
  {
   "id": "<workerId>",
   "status": "running",
   "os": "OS X",
   "os_version": "Mojave",
   "browser": "chrome",
   "browser_version": "75.0",
   "real_mobile": null,
   "device": null,
   "browser_url": "<dashboard_url_of_the_session>",
   "sessionId": "<sessionId>"
  },
 {
    "id": "<workerId>",
    "status": "queue",
    "device": "Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9",
    "os": "android",
    "os_version": "2.2",
    "browser_url": "<dashboard_url_of_the_session>",
    "sessionId": "<sessionId>"
  } ...]
```

## Terminating a Browser Worker

Use this method to terminate a worker. Useful if you set the worker up to run indefinitely or if you've received all the information needed and you want to save on credit time.

```http
DELETE  /worker/<id>
```

The `id` is the id returned when you first created the worker. Once called the browser instance will be immediately terminated and will no longer be accessible.

> Note: _This call requires authentication. If the request was made unauthorized a `401 Unauthorized` response is given. Alternatively, if the authorized user is not the owner of the worker or `id` does not exist a `403 Forbidden` response is given. Also, if this request is sent within 60 seconds of starting the worker, the response will be `422 Unprocessable Entity` and the worker will be terminated after 60 seconds of its running time._

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" -X DELETE https://api.browserstack.com/5/worker/123456789
```

## Getting Worker Status

Sometimes you will need to check on the status of a worker. Not to be confused with the state of the javascript environment within the worker, this method simply determines whether the worker is in the queue, running or terminated.

```http
GET /worker/<id>
```

> _This call requires authentication. If the request was made unauthorized a `401 Unauthorized` response is given. Alternatively, if the authorized user is not the owner of the worker a `403 Forbidden` response is given._

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5/worker/123456789
```

If the worker has been terminated an empty response is given. Otherwise, you get a response with status and browser details.

```javascript
{
  status: 'running',
  browser: 'ie',
  browser_version: '6.0',
  os: 'Windows',
  os_version: 'XP',
  sessionId: "<sessionId>",
  browser_url: "<dashboard url for the session>"
}
```

If you want to know the list of your current workers with their status, use the following method.

```http
GET /workers
```

This method will return the list of workers whose status is either `queue` or `running`.

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5/workers
```

Response:

```javascript
[
  {
    status: 'running',
    browser: 'ie',
    version: '6.0',
    os: 'Windows',
    os_version: 'XP',
    sessionId: "<sessionId>",
    browser_url: "<dashboard url for the session>"
  },
  {
    status: 'queue',
    device: 'Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9',
    os: 'android',
    os_version: '2.2',
    sessionId: "<sessionId>",
    browser_url: "<dashboard url for the session>"
  } ...
]
```

## Getting API Status

If you want to know the status of your API, use the following method

```http
GET /status
```

This will return the current status of API, like how much API time has been used and how many workers are running parallelly. All the paid plans have no time limits, only limit on parallel workers you can create.

For example:

```bash
curl -u "username:access_key" https://api.browserstack.com/5/status
```

```javascript
  {
    used_time: 4235.4,
    total_available_time: 6000,
    running_sessions: 1,
    sessions_limit: 1
  }
```

The time returned is in seconds.

If a user runs out of API time, all requests will return the following response

```javascript
{
  message: "You have run out of API time"
}
```

> **Note**: _You can make up to 1600 API requests every 5 minutes._
